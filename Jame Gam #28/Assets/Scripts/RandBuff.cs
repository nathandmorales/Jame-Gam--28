    /*Certainly! Here's a list of random buffs for a player in a 2D platformer where you kill enemies in a wave-based pattern:

1. Super Speed: The player moves at an increased speed for a limited time, allowing them to quickly navigate through levels and dodge enemy attacks.
6. Haste: The player's movement speed and attack speed are significantly increased for a limited duration, allowing for rapid strikes and agile maneuvering.
2. Mega Jump: The player gains the ability to jump higher than usual, granting them access to higher platforms and unreachable areas.
5. Double Damage: The player deals twice the amount of damage to enemies, making it easier to defeat tougher foes.
7. Ricochet Shots: The player's projectiles bounce off walls or enemies, allowing them to hit multiple targets with a single shot.
8. Elemental Enhancement: The player's attacks gain an elemental effect, such as fire, ice, or electricity, causing additional damage or applying status effects to enemies.
9. Time Slow: The player can temporarily slow down time, giving them an advantage in combat by allowing them to react more quickly to enemy movements.
12. Time Freeze: The player can freeze time for a short duration, immobilizing enemies and allowing for precise movements or strategic planning.
10. Multi-Shot: The player fires multiple projectiles simultaneously, increasing their attack coverage and making it easier to hit enemies.
11. Explosive Rounds: The player's projectiles explode upon impact, dealing area-of-effect damage to nearby enemies. Can Damage yourself
13. Invisible Dash: The player can dash through enemies and obstacles without taking damage, temporarily turning invisible during the dash.
14. Chain Lightning: The player's attacks chain between multiple enemies, damaging all connected targets.
7. Power Overload: The player's attacks become charged with energy, dealing increased damage and potentially causing explosions upon impact.
9. Reflective Aura: The player emits an aura that reflects enemy projectiles back at them, turning the tables on ranged attackers.
2. Time Rewind: The player can rewind time for a short duration, undoing their mistakes or recovering lost health.
3. Bouncing Bullets: The player's projectiles bounce off surfaces, allowing them to hit enemies around corners or reach hidden areas.
1. Elemental Transformation: The player transforms into an elemental form (fire, ice, etc.) granting unique abilities and attacks based on the element.
